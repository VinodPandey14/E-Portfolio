        <h3>Week-1 : Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In our lab sessions, I learned how to effectively introduce myself
          in various professional and academic settings. The importance of
          confidence, clarity, and structuring an introduction was emphasized.
          We practiced crafting introductions that included our name, academic
          background, interests, and career aspirations. Additionally, I
          learned how to tailor my introduction based on the audience, whether
          in interviews, networking events, or formal presentations. The
          session also covered non-verbal cues like eye contact, tone, and
          body language to leave a lasting impression. This helped me refine
          my ability to introduce myself in both casual and professional
          settings with ease.

        <h3>Week-2 : Resume</h3>
        <p>
          The session on resumes taught me the significance of creating a
          well-structured and impactful resume to highlight my skills and
          achievements. I learned about different resume formats, including
          chronological, functional, and hybrid, and when to use each one.
          Emphasis was placed on writing strong bullet points that showcase
          accomplishments using action verbs and quantifiable results. We also
          covered the importance of ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) and how
          to optimize resumes with keywords for better visibility.
          Additionally, I practiced customizing my resume for specific job
          roles by focusing on relevant skills and experiences. This session
          helped me build a professional and polished resume that effectively
          represents my qualifications.

        <h3>Week-3 : Extempore</h3>
        <p>
          Through our extempore sessions, I developed the ability to think
          quickly and articulate my thoughts clearly under time constraints. I
          learned how to structure my response in a logical flow—starting with
          an introduction, presenting key points, and concluding effectively.
          The session emphasized the importance of staying calm, organizing
          thoughts quickly, and delivering ideas confidently. I practiced
          speaking on random topics, which improved my spontaneity and
          fluency. Additionally, I gained insights into handling difficult
          topics by breaking them down into smaller ideas and supporting them
          with examples. This experience enhanced my communication skills and
          prepared me for public speaking and interview scenarios.

        <h3>Week-4 : Movie Review</h3>
        <h4>Movie: The Shawshank Redemption</h4>
        <p>
          <b>Review:</b> The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful film about
          hope, perseverance, and redemption. It follows Andy Dufresne, a
          wrongfully convicted banker, who navigates prison life while
          secretly planning his escape. The movie teaches resilience, as
          Andy’s patience and optimism keep him going despite adversity. His
          deep friendship with Red highlights the value of trust and support
          in difficult times. The film also explores the effects of
          institutionalization and the struggle for freedom. Andy’s escape and
          exposure of corruption serve as poetic justice, reinforcing the
          theme of redemption.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Favourite Dialogue:</b>
          <i>"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good
            thing ever dies."
          </i>
          This dialogue is inspiring as it emphasizes the power of hope in
          overcoming challenges. It reminds us that no matter how tough life
          gets, hope can guide us toward a better future.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Learning Takeaways:</b> The film teaches the importance of
          resilience, the power of friendship, and the need to embrace change.
          It also highlights the flaws in the justice system and the impact of
          institutionalization on individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Related Classroom Concepts:</b> The movie connects with concepts
          like resilience and mindset, ethics and justice, and communication
          skills—topics that we have explored in self-development and ethics
          discussions.

        <h3>Week-5 : Public Speaking</h3>
        <h4>Today's Learning</h4>
        <p>
          Public speaking, once a fear-inducing challenge for me, turned into
          a transformative experience this week. I learned that the heart of
          good public speaking lies in genuine connection — with the topic and
          the audience. It’s not about perfection, but presence. The session
          emphasized crafting an engaging introduction, maintaining a natural
          flow, and using pauses to add weight to words. I practiced vocal
          modulation — changing tone, pace, and pitch — to avoid sounding
          monotonous. Through JAM and extempore activities, I discovered how
          quick thinking and calmness can work together. I also understood
          that strong body language, eye contact, and gestures are not just
          enhancements — they’re essential. This session gave me the
          confidence to face an audience and speak with purpose, not fear.

        <h3>Week-6 : Essay Writing</h3>
        <p>
          Essay writing taught me how to give form and structure to my
          thoughts, turning raw ideas into impactful expressions. I learned
          how to write clear and concise introductions that set the stage,
          develop body paragraphs that offer depth and analysis, and end with
          a conclusion that leaves a lasting impression. The session also
          highlighted the importance of transitions between ideas, maintaining
          a consistent tone, and avoiding grammatical pitfalls. We practiced
          brainstorming, outlining, and refining drafts — which taught me that
          great writing is often the result of great editing. Most
          importantly, I discovered how to express opinions respectfully,
          support arguments with logic, and make writing reflect my
          personality. Essay writing is no longer a formality to me — it has
          become a tool to express who I am and what I believe in.

        <h3>Week-7 : Group Discussion</h3>
        <p>
          The group discussion session taught me the delicate balance between
          assertiveness and empathy. I realized that being a good speaker is
          only half the job — being an attentive listener is equally powerful.
          I learned how to enter a discussion respectfully, contribute
          relevant and unique points, and build on others’ ideas instead of
          merely competing. The session also showed how teamwork, respect, and
          staying focused on the topic can make a discussion productive rather
          than chaotic. I became aware of habits like interrupting, straying
          from the topic, or using an overly aggressive tone — and how to
          consciously avoid them. This experience shaped my perspective on
          communication in group settings, helping me see discussions as
          opportunities for collective growth rather than individual
          victories.

        <h3>Week-8 : Interview Skills</h3>
        <h4>Today's Learning</h4>
        <p>
          This week’s focus on interview skills gave me a much-needed lens
          into how to represent myself professionally with clarity,
          authenticity, and calmness. I learned how to prepare
          well-thought-out responses for typical questions like "Tell me about
          yourself", "What are your strengths and weaknesses?" or "Describe a
          challenge you faced". Using the STAR technique (Situation, Task,
          Action, Result), I practiced turning my real-life experiences into
          powerful answers. I also worked on body language — sitting upright,
          smiling naturally, and maintaining eye contact — to convey
          confidence even before speaking. We had mock interviews that
          revealed my nervous tics and areas of improvement, but more
          importantly, they gave me the courage to be myself. I now understand
          that interviews are not just evaluations — they’re opportunities to
          show who I truly am and what I bring to the table.
