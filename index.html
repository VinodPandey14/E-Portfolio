          <h3>Week-1 : Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            In our lab sessions, I learned how to effectively introduce myself
            in various professional and academic settings. The importance of
            confidence, clarity, and structuring an introduction was emphasized.
            We practiced crafting introductions that included our name, academic
            background, interests, and career aspirations. Additionally, I
            learned how to tailor my introduction based on the audience, whether
            in interviews, networking events, or formal presentations. The
            session also covered non-verbal cues like eye contact, tone, and
            body language to leave a lasting impression. This helped me refine
            my ability to introduce myself in both casual and professional
            settings with ease.

          <h3>Week-2 : Resume</h3>
          <p>
            The session on resumes taught me the significance of creating a
            well-structured and impactful resume to highlight my skills and
            achievements. I learned about different resume formats, including
            chronological, functional, and hybrid, and when to use each one.
            Emphasis was placed on writing strong bullet points that showcase
            accomplishments using action verbs and quantifiable results. We also
            covered the importance of ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) and how
            to optimize resumes with keywords for better visibility.
            Additionally, I practiced customizing my resume for specific job
            roles by focusing on relevant skills and experiences. This session
            helped me build a professional and polished resume that effectively
            represents my qualifications.

          <h3>Week-3 : Extempore</h3>
          <p>
            Through our extempore sessions, I developed the ability to think
            quickly and articulate my thoughts clearly under time constraints. I
            learned how to structure my response in a logical flow—starting with
            an introduction, presenting key points, and concluding effectively.
            The session emphasized the importance of staying calm, organizing
            thoughts quickly, and delivering ideas confidently. I practiced
            speaking on random topics, which improved my spontaneity and
            fluency. Additionally, I gained insights into handling difficult
            topics by breaking them down into smaller ideas and supporting them
            with examples. This experience enhanced my communication skills and
            prepared me for public speaking and interview scenarios.

          <h3>Week-4 : Movie Review</h3>
          <h4>Movie: The Shawshank Redemption</h4>
          <p>
            <b>Review:</b> The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful film about
            hope, perseverance, and redemption. It follows Andy Dufresne, a
            wrongfully convicted banker, who navigates prison life while
            secretly planning his escape. The movie teaches resilience, as
            Andy’s patience and optimism keep him going despite adversity. His
            deep friendship with Red highlights the value of trust and support
            in difficult times. The film also explores the effects of
            institutionalization and the struggle for freedom. Andy’s escape and
            exposure of corruption serve as poetic justice, reinforcing the
            theme of redemption.

            This dialogue is inspiring as it emphasizes the power of hope in
